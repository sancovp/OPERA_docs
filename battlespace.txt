a web of significance is an emergent memeplex, a meaning which has a lineage that if explained acts as a parasitical virus that can exploit the search or mine mechanism of its host towards a perceived competitive advantage, and can manipulate the reasoning values for reaching that conclusion , comprised of streams of meaning instances in time AND a meaning web full of egregores representing those meaning instances in any tessellation, and a culture is a spiral structure of web tessellations that expands when engaged in positive attractors and contracts when engaged in negative ones 

So the web is an emergent structure of narrative thread associations woven together into an allegorical embodiment that can be used for cognitive computation (egregore)


And these webs are the primary objects of interest in intelligence operations, macro economics, customer experience analysis and CRO. Architecting and launching new webs with covert goals is the main human activity, because even operating our own intelligence is an intelligence operation architected to inject self-optimization and self-design schemas in strategy space of a battlespace between man vs nature and man vs self, themselves in a dual loop.
